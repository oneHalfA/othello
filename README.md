# Reversi (Othello)

Reversi, also known as Othello, is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. The objective is to have the majority of your color discs on the board at the end of the game.

## Game Rules

1. **Starting Position**:
   - The game starts with four discs placed in the center of the board in a square formation. The two black discs are placed on one diagonal, and the two white discs are placed on the other diagonal.

2. **Turns**:
   - Black always goes first.
   - Players take turns placing a disc of their color on an empty square.

3. **Flipping Discs**:
   - When a disc is placed on the board, it must outflank one or more of the opponent's discs.
   - To outflank means to place a disc such that there is a continuous line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of the opponent's discs between the newly placed disc and another disc of the player's color.
   - All of the opponent's discs that are outflanked are flipped to the player's color.

4. **Valid Moves**:
   - If a player cannot make a valid move, they must pass their turn.
   - If both players cannot make a valid move, the game ends.

5. **End of the Game**:
   - The game ends when neither player can make a valid move, usually when the board is full.
   - The player with the majority of their color discs on the board wins.
